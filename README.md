#Credit Risk Analysis Report

##Overview:
The purpose of this analysis is to build and evaluate a logistic regression model for credit risk assessment. By analyzing historical lending data, we aim to develop a predictive model that can distinguish between healthy loans and high-risk loans.

##Model Performance:

###Accuracy Score:
The logistic regression model achieved an accuracy score of 99%, indicating its overall predictive capability.

###Precision Score:
For healthy loans (label 0), the precision is 100%, suggesting that the model correctly identifies all healthy loans among the predicted ones.
For high-risk loans (label 1), the precision is 85%, indicating that the model correctly identifies 85% of the high-risk loans among the predicted ones.

###Recall Score:
For healthy loans (label 0), the recall is 99%, indicating that the model correctly captures 99% of all actual healthy loans.
For high-risk loans (label 1), the recall is 91%, suggesting that the model correctly captures 91% of all actual high-risk loans.

###Summary:
The logistic regression model demonstrates strong predictive performance for both healthy and high-risk loans. It exhibits high accuracy, precision, and recall scores, indicating its effectiveness in identifying credit risk. Therefore, I recommend using this model for credit risk assessment in the company's lending operations. Its robust performance suggests that it can assist in making informed decisions regarding loan approvals and risk management strategies.
